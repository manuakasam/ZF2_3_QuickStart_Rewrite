ZF2_3_QuickStart_Rewrite
========================

This repository is the home of a new introduction into the world of the Zend Framework 2 and following versions for
the official documentation. It's aim is to be far more verbose than the current QuickStart to make it easier for users
to understand what ZF2++ is all about, how does it work, what do error messages mean, etc...

Discussing the outline
======================

In this repository you'll only see the file outline.md. This file contains all the content that I plan to write. If
there's any contents missing, be sure to point this out in here.

Discussing the chapters
=======================

Each chapter has it's own branch and will be managed through a PR. Please check the following links for each chapter.
