ZF2_3_QuickStart_Rewrite
========================

This repository is the home of a new introduction into the world of the Zend Framework 2 and following versions for
the official documentation. It's aim is to be far more verbose than the current QuickStart to make it easier for users
to understand what ZF2++ is all about, how does it work, what do error messages mean, etc...

Discussing the outline
======================

In this repository you'll only see the file outline.md. This file contains all the content that I plan to write. If
there's any contents missing, be sure to point this out in here.

Demo Application
================

The whole code for the AlbumDemoApplication can be found in this repository

- [manuakasam/ZF3AlbumDemo](https://github.com/manuakasam/ZF3AlbumDemo)

There's a couple of differences to the code layed out within the tutorial as that code is just
a proof of concept I did. It will be updated to PHP 5.3 standards at a later point in time.
