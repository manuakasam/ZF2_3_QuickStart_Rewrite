Introducing our first "Album" Module
====================================

Now that we know about the basics of the Zend Framework 2 Skeleton Application, let's continue and create our very own
module. We will create a module named "Album". This module will display a list of database entries that represent a
single music album. Each album will receive a couple of properties like `id`, `artist` and `title`. We will create forms
to enter new albums into our database and to edit existing albums. Furthermore we will do so by using best-practices
throughout the whole QuickStart.


Writing a new Module
====================

Let's start by creating a new folder under the `/module` directory called `Album`. Your directory structure should look
like this:

[[ DISPLAY IMAGE - DIRECTORY STRUCTURE /module/Album ]]

To be recognized as a module by the [ModuleManager](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/:current_branch/library/Zend/ModuleManager/ModuleManager.php)
all we need to do is create a PHP-Class named `Module` under our module's namespace, which is `Album`. Create the file
`/module/Album/Module.php` [[ LINK IMAGE - CURRENT DIRECTORY STRUCTURE /module/Album/Module.php ]]

```php
<?php
// Filename: /module/Album/src/Album/Module.php
namespace Album;

class Module
{
}
```

We now have a module that can be detected by Zend Frameworks [`ModuleManager`](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/:current_branch/library/Zend/ModuleManager/ModuleManager.php).
Let's add this module to our application. Although our module doesn't do anything yet, just having the `Module.php`
class allows it to be loaded by Zend Framework's [`ModuleManager`](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/:current_branch/library/Zend/ModuleManager/ModuleManager.php).
To do this, add an entry for `Album` to the modules array inside the main application config file at
`/config/application.config.php`:

```php
<?php
// Filename: /config/application.config.php
return array(
    'modules' => array(
        'Application',
        'Album'         //@todo Highlight this line at .rts
    ),

    // ...
);
```

If you refresh your application you should see no change at all (but also no errors).

At this point it's worth taking a step back to discuss what modules are for. In short, a module is an encapsulated
set of features for your application. A module might add features to the application that you can see, like our
Album module; or it might provide background functionality for other modules in the application to use,  such as
interacting with a third party API.

Organizing your code into modules makes it easier for you to reuse functionality in other application, or to use
modules written by the community.

Configuring the Module
======================

The next thing we're going to do is add a route to our application so that our module can be accessed through the
URL `domain.loc/album`. We do this by adding router configuration to our module, but first we need to let the
`ModuleManager` know that our module has configuration that it needs to load.

This is done by adding a `getConfig()` function to the `Module` class that returns the configuration. (This function is
defined in the `ConfigProviderInterface` although actually implementing this interface in the module class is optional.)
This function should return either an `array` or a `Traversable` object. Continue by editing your
`/module/Album/Module.php`:

```php
<?php
// Filename: /module/Album/src/Album/Module.php
namespace Album;

use Zend\ModuleManager\Feature\ConfigProviderInterface;

class Module implements ConfigProviderInterface
{
    public function getConfig()
    {
        return array();
    }
}
```

With this we let the [`ModuleManager`](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/:current_branch/library/Zend/ModuleManager/ModuleManager.php)
know that our module does provide some configuration for the application. However we are not done yet. The `getConfig()`
function expects to return an `array` or `\Traversable` object. We will stick with the `array` version. To further keep our
project organized in a good fashion we actually outsource this array into a separate file. Go ahead and create this
file under `/module/Album/config/module.config.php`:

```php
<?php
// Filename: /module/Album/config/module.config.php
return array();
```

Now we will rewrite the `getConfig()` function to include this newly created file instead of directly returning the
array.

```php
<?php
// Filename: /module/Album/src/Album/Module.php
namespace Album;

use Zend\ModuleManager\Feature\ConfigProviderInterface;

class Module implements ConfigProviderInterface
{
    public function getConfig()
    {
        return include __DIR__ . '/config/module.config.php';
    }
}
```

Try reloading your application once and you'll see that everything remains as it is and no error occurs. This is so
because we haven't actually added any configuration to our module yet. Let's finally get started and add the new route
to our module:

```php
<?php
// Filename: /module/Album/config/module.config.php
return array(
    // This lines opens the configuration for the RouteManager
    'router' => array(
        // Open configuration for all possible routes
        'routes' => array(
            // Create a new route called "album-default"
            'album-default' => array(
                // Define the routes type to be "Literal", which is basically just a string
                'type' => 'Zend\Mvc\Router\Http\Literal',
                // Configure the route itself
                'options' => array(
                    // Listen to "/album" as uri
                    'route'    => '/album',
                    // Define default controller and action to be called when this route is matched
                    'defaults' => array(
                        'controller' => 'Album\Controller\List',
                        'action'     => 'index',
                    ),
                ),
            )
        )
    )
);
```

With this we have created a new route called `album-default` that listens to the url `domain.loc/album`. Whenever
someone accesses this route a controller called `Album\Controller\List` will be accessed and more precisely its
`indexAction()`. The problem is that this controller does not yet exist and if you reload the page you will be greeted
with this lovely error message:

```text
A 404 error occurred
Page not found.
The requested controller could not be mapped to an existing controller class.

Controller:
Album\Controller\List(resolves to invalid controller class or alias: Album\Controller\List)
No Exception available
```

We now need to tell our module where to find this controller named `Album\Controller\List`. To achieve this we have
to add this key to the `controllers` configuration key inside your `/module/Album/config/module.config.php`.

```php
<?php
// Filename: /module/Album/config/module.config.php
return array(
    'controllers' => array(
        'invokables' => array(
            'Album\Controller\List' => 'Album\Controller\ListController'
        )
    ),
    'router' => array(
        // our previous route configuration
    )
);
```

The above configuration lets the application know that the controller key `Album\Controller\List` is meant as an alias
for the class `ListController` under the namespace `Album\Controller`. Sadly though this isn't enough yet. Reloading
the page results into yet another error:

```text
( ! ) Fatal error: Class 'Album\Controller\ListController' not found in {libPath}/Zend/ServiceManager/AbstractPluginManager.php on line {lineNumber}
```

This error tells us that the application know what class we want to access but sadly it simply cannot find the class.
That happens because our module never told the application where to find the classes that our module provides. Telling
the application where to find classes is done by providing [autoloader](http://php.net/manual/de/language.oop5.autoload.php)
configuration. This is done by add√≠ng and implementing the [`AutoloaderProviderInterface`](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/:current_branch/library/Zend/ModuleManager/Feature/AutoloaderProviderInterface.php)
to our `Module` class. Note that once again adding the interface is optional, all you need is the `getAutoloaderConfig()`
function defined by the interface.

```php
<?php
// Filename: /module/Album/src/Album/Module.php
namespace Album;

use Zend\ModuleManager\Feature\AutoloaderProviderInterface;
use Zend\ModuleManager\Feature\ConfigProviderInterface;

class Module implements
    AutoloaderProviderInterface,
    ConfigProviderInterface
{
    public function getAutoloaderConfig()
    {
        return array(
            'Zend\Loader\StandardAutoloader' => array(
                'namespaces' => array(
                    // Autoload all classes from namespace 'Album' from '/module/Album/src/Album'
                    __NAMESPACE__ => __DIR__ . '/src/' . __NAMESPACE__,
                )
            )
        );
    }

    public function getConfig()
    {
        return include __DIR__ . '/config/module.config.php';
    }
}
```

Now this looks like a lot of change but don't be afraid. The [`AutoloaderProviderInterface`](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/:current_branch/library/Zend/ModuleManager/Feature/AutoloaderProviderInterface.php)
defines that our module has to tell the application where to find its classes. For this we have a pretty easy
implementation of the `Zend\Loader\StandardAutoloader` that tells the application that all classes under the namespace
`__NAMESPACE__` (`Album`) are found inside the `/src` folder inside the current directory and then once again inside a
folder that's named like our namespace. So:

All classes that have the namespace `Album` are found inside `/module/Album/src/Album`. This holds true as long as we
hold on to [`PSR-0`](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md). `PSR-0` is a community
driven standard that describes the mandatory requirements that must be adhered to for autoloader interoperability.

If you refresh the browser now you'll see that the error remains the same. And this is logical because remember what
we did by now. We do have told the application where to find the controller now, but we have yet to actually write the
controller itself. Let's create a controller class `Album\Controller\ListController`. To reflect [`PSR-0`](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md)
we do separate namespaces into folders so you'll find this file under
`/module/Album/src/Album/Controller/ListController.php`:

```php
<?php
// Filename: /module/Album/src/Album/Controller/ListController.php
namespace Album\Controller;

class ListController {}
```

Reloading the page now will finally result into a new screen. The new error message looks like this:

```text
A 404 error occurred
Page not found.
The requested controller was not dispatchable.

Controller:
Album\Controller\List(resolves to invalid controller class or alias: Album\Controller\List)

Additional information:
Zend\Mvc\Exception\InvalidControllerException

File:
{libraryPath}/Zend/Mvc/Controller/ControllerManager.php:{lineNumber}
Message:
Controller of type Album\Controller\ListController is invalid; must implement Zend\Stdlib\DispatchableInterface
```

This happens because our controller must implement [`Zend\Stdlib\DispatchableInterface`](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/:current_branch/library/Zend/Stdlib/DispatchableInterface.php) in order to be 'dispatched'
(or run) by ZendFramework's MVC layer. ZendFramework provides some base controller implementation of it with
[`AbstractActionController`](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/:current_branch/library/Zend/Mvc/Controller/AbstractActionController.php),
which we are going to use. Let's modify our controller now:

```php
<?php
// Filename: /module/Album/src/Album/Controller/ListController.php
namespace Album\Controller;

use Zend\Mvc\Controller\AbstractActionController;

class ListController extends AbstractActionController {}
```

It's now time for another refresh of the site. Big surprise, there's another error message for you.

```text
An error occurred
An error occurred during execution; please try again later.

Additional information:
Zend\View\Exception\RuntimeException

File:
{libraryPath}/library/Zend/View/Renderer/PhpRenderer.php:{lineNumber}
Message:
Zend\View\Renderer\PhpRenderer::render: Unable to render template "album/list/index"; resolver could not resolve to a file
```

Now the application tells you that a view template-file can not be rendered. Given our current progress this is more
than natural, because we have yet to actually write this view-file ourselves. The standard path would be
`/module/Album/view/album/list/index.phtml`. Create this file and add some dummy content to it:

```html
<!-- Filename: /module/Album/view/album/list/index.phtml -->
<h1>Album\ListController::indexAction()</h1>
```

Before we continue let us quickly take a look at where we placed this file. First off, view files are not to be found
under the `/src` directory because they are not source files. They are views so `/view` is much more logical. The
succeeding path however deserves some explanation but it's very simple. First we have the lowercased namespace. Following
by the lowercased controller name without the appendix 'controller' and lastly comes the name of the action that we are
accessing, again without the appendix 'action'. All in all it looks like this: `/view/{namespace}/{controller}/{action}.phtml`.
This has become a community standard but can potentionally be changed by you at any time.

However creating this file alone is not enough and this brings as to the final topic of this part of the QuickStart. We
need to let the application know where to look for view files. We do this within our modules configuration file `module.config.php`.

```php
<?php
// Filename: /module/Album/config/module.config.php
return array(
    'view_manager' => array(
        'template_path_stack' => array(
            __DIR__ . '/../view',
        ),
    ),
    'controllers' => array(
        // our previous controllers configuration
    ),
    'router' => array(
        // our previous route configuration
    )
);
```

The above configuration tells the application that the folder `/module/Album/view` has view files in it that match the
above described default scheme. It is important to note that with this you can not only ship view files for your module
but you can also overwrite view files from other modules. You can find more information about this inside our Appendix
section of the QuickStart. //@todo Appendix link

Reload your site now. Finally we are at a point where we see something different than an error display. Congratulations,
not only have you created a simple "Hello World" kinda module, you also learned about many error messages and their
sources. If we didn't exhaust you too much, continue with our QuickStart and let's create a module that actually does
something.
